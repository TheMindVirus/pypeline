[components]
* each different type of rotation forms a different component e.g. roller wheel on the desk
* the order in which x y and z are rotated determines the type of fixture
* "circle to search line" is a term incorrectly misplaced to mean "circle to square edge"
* "circle to square edge" actually means "sphere to cube surface" and is currently only approximated
* "sphere to cube surface" is an incomplete version of "sphere to cube angle" and loosely follows triangle
* triangle wave is an incomplete description of a "bulging slab pillow" of which is graphically plotted
* the bulging slab pillow points the articulator exactly to the corner of the cube instead of the sphere
* the arc solver has multiple solutions like sqrt has 2-4 solutions but the radiocube has at least 8-32
* which quadrant the 3d linear equation is in determines which of 32 answers is given by the generator
* a netball shape needs further boolean modifiers to work standalone so blender is used as a voxel engine
* the intersection of the equations and theorems will show up both in blender and in a graphical calculator
* pypeline requires a mod which shows the 3d intersection of multiple linear equations in 2d and 3d
